Just a couple of scripts to download the Zillow neighborhood boundary definitions [http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm) and load them into a local Postgres (with GIS plugins) database. Also download associated real-estate data [http://www.zillow.com/research/data/](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/). To-do: add some basic reporting/analysis examples that you can do with the data, load the metrics data into the database.
